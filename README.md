# Python for Testing
 
Recently, I have found myself walking through newbies to all things programming 
to contributing to programmatic tests. Some people keep these tests hidden on 
their own computers, as throwaway code that does already some work for them 
while they learn. Others start with small changes into automatically running 
tests of their teams, growing in comfort with reading and tiny changes. 

This collects some of the things I find myself teaching.
